If you don't feed your model enought data it might have a hard time finding the patterns neccesery for accurate predictions, too much data on the other hand will make the model \"remember\" too much irrelevant informations that doesn't have an impact on your target.\n",

In all of the tested cases tho, strategy implemented by the model have outperformed long term stock investment. While that is true there are still ways to improve the model accuracy: in all 3 simulations the model was over optimistic: it predicted much more False Positives than False Negatives. Naturally the next step would be to look closser into those cases and try to determin what is reason for such an outcome."
