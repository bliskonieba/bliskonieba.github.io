If you don't feed your model enought data it might have a hard time finding the patterns neccesery for accurate predictions, too much data on the other hand will make the model \"remember\" too much irrelevant informations that doesn't have an impact on your target.\n",

Different sizes of a batch and different number of batches in whole dataset will be make your model recognize various relations between the features and thus reflect on the predictions."

Naturally the next step would be to look closser into those cases and try to determin what is reason for such an outcome."
